# Telecom Churn contigency

## About
This is the mini project of Group 4 from Lab Group FCEE for SC1015(Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence).

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the spread of fake news has been increasing. Therefore, our team decided to focus on analyzing fake news.

## Brief process walkthrough 

1. [Data Preparation & Cleaning]
    - Data cleaning
      - Salvage empty rows with mean value
      - Drop empty rows after all cleaning steps (Dirty data)
      - Dropping of unrelevant columns
        
    - Data generation
      - Upsampling of the minority classes to ensure overall balance.

2. [Exploratory Data Analysis]
   - Class analysis
   - Wordcount & charcount analysis
   - Author analysis
   - Corpus analysis
   - N-gram analysis
   - Sentiment & emotion analysis
   - Parts-of-speech (POS) analysis
   - Correlation analysis
  
3. [Model Training Attempt 1]

     - Average accuracy: 0.00
     - Model evaluation
       - Plotting decision tree
       - Confusion matrix
        
4. [Model Training Attempt 4]
   - Attempt 2 (Random Forest)
     - Train with top 5 predictors
