Brief process walkthrough (In order)
Data Preparation & Cleaning

Data cleaning
Salvage empty rows with mean value
One Hot encoding of categorical variables
Drop empty rows after all cleaning steps (Dirty data)
Data generation via upsampling



Exploratory Data Analysis

Upsampling

With normal cleaned dataset:
Attempt 1 (Logistic Regression)


Attempt 2 (KNN Clustering)



Attempt 3 (Decision Tree)


Attempt 4 (Random Forest)
Train with top 20 K-best predictors
Average accuracy: 
Model evaluation
Confusion matrix
Grid search hyper-parameter tuning
